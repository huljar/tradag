# TraDaG - Training Data Generator

TraDaG is a C++ software that can be used to produce training data for object recognition
algorithms by inserting arbitrary objects into scenes given as RGB-D images.

For all further information, please refer to the extensive documentation that can be generated
with Doxygen (see below).

# How to generate documentation

1. Install Doxygen
2. Run 'doxygen' in this directory
3. The output will be written to ./docs
4. If you want another output format instead of HTML (e.g. LaTeX), edit the Doxyfile
